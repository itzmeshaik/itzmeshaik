Learning JavaScript!

I know some Python basics(I actually began with this language but I later switched to web. Will probably get back to it later).

I know some basic Java. A refresher would be nice though🤔...
<br>
I use neovim for my own projects in my own free time but I use VS code when following tutorials.
<br>
I know how to use arch linux, know basic commands, and how the system works.
<br>
Bash, idk the icon just looked cool...
<br>
I use linux. I've used countless distros.

# Achivements
